						h4 Introduction
						p In the following analysis of "The DOA," we've identified four distinct time frames, each characterized by different user behavior. These time frames are (1) the <a href=/detailCreation>Creation Period</a>, (2) the <a href=/detailOperational>Operational Period</a>, (3) the <a href=/detailPostHack>Post-Hack Period</a>, and (4) the <a href=/detailRecovery>Recovery Period</a>. The start of each period is signaled by an uptick in activity as can be seen by the green- and orange-shaded areas. This analysis documents notable aspects of each time period and proposes possible explanations for each.
						p It is important to note, before we begin, that this analysis is a "work-in-progress." There is much missing information. Three prominent bits of missing information are the 'ether' balance of the contract, the inclusion of 'internal transactions,' and an analysis of 'in-error' transactions. The primary reason for the lack of these data from our analysis is the word 'quick' in our company's name. This information is available, but to the best of our knowledge, it's not available 'quickly.' This is what we're working on. More about this issue is on the <a href="/aboutFAQ">FAQ</a> page.
						p On with the analysis. Below we discuss briefly each of the four distinct time periods we've identified. Access to further detail for each period is provided by the menu-bar to the left or by following the links below.
						h4 Four Periods
						ol
							li We've designated the first period of activity (the pink section above) as the <b>Creation Period</b>. Noteworthy is the spike in token creation on May 14th which was initially reported to be the last day of the 1:100 token price. A slightly smaller spike appears the next day, May 15th. The existence of this second 'fantom' spike is, we believe, the result of <a target=_blank href="https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-dao-price-increase-explanation/2018">a mistake on the DAOHub website</a>. Understandably, due to the excitement generated by the smart contract, a further spike in activity is seen at the end of the period. Further analysis is available on the <a href="/detailCreation">Creation Period</a> page.
							br
							li A huge spike in activity, immediately after the end of the creation period, marks the beginning of the <b>Operational Period</b>. Many of the transactions in this initial spike come from three or four accounts (assumed to be exchanges). Notice the small, blue area near the bottom of the chart during this period. This is proposal making activity (voting, etc.). Proposal related activity and voting are the distinguishing characteristics of this period and are further discussed on the <a href="/detailOperational">Operational Period</a> page.
							br
							li While significantly smaller, the next spike in activity happens as a result of the hack. This marks the beginning of the <b>Post Hack</b> period. After the initial flurry of 'panic selling', the period is characterized by relative quiescence and declining activity due, we believe, to uncertainty and an early direct instruction from 'the white hat group' to refrain from interacting with The DAO. Many of the transactions during this period were initiated by the white hat group. The <a href="/detailPostHack">Post Hack</a> period is discussed on its associated page.
							br
							li The final period we've identified, the <b>Recovery Period</b>, is marked by another spike in activity as well as the advent of the DAO Withdraw Contract. This pattern results from users reclaiming their ether through a two-step process of approval and then withdraw. After an initial spike, this withdraw activity quickly dies down as discussed in <a target=_blank href="http://www.coindesk.com/25-million-of-dao-ether-still-remain-one-month-after-hard-fork/">this article</a>. A more detailed analysis of this last period, the <a href="/detailRecovery">Recovery Period</a> is provided.
							br
							li A possible fifth activity spike seems to have occurred on or around August 17th; however, we do not discuss this fifth period in this analysis.

						h4 Conclusion
						p "The DAO" was an amazing ride. The initial excitement of an un-managed piece of software raising $150,000,000 US dollars in 30 days--even given the fact that there was no-one in charge--was exhilarating. And then, on the morning of the hack, when we all woke up to find that the price of ether had plummeted (along with my naive belief that it was possible to  write an immutable, un-hackable piece of software) was epic. Further, the way the community marshaled itself and carried out the hard fork was inspiring, that inspiration only to be dashed soon thereafter by the zombie-like resurrection of ETC after the community incorrectly assumed that it would die a quiet death. It's been an amazing ride.
						p On a personal note, I've enjoyed tracking the data generated by "The DAO". It is this desire that gave me an impetus to develop the tools I needed to complete my task (i.e. this website and the <a target=_blank href="http://ethslurp.com">EthSlurp</a> software). I hope you enjoyed reading our analysis. If we can do anything for you--for example create a monitoring website similar to this one to monitor or analyze your smart contract--please <a href="/usContact">contact us</a>. We'll be happy to speak with you.
						p ------<br><b>Notes:</b> The effect of the hack on the price of Ether is very obvious, as is--a few days after the hard fork--the effect of Ether Classic not dying a peaceful death. All transactions represented on these charts <em>exclude</em> "in-error" transactions unless otherwise noted. "Functional groups" are further explained below. <b>TODO:</b> (1) Display the total accumulated ether (and US dollar value) and DAO tokens on all appropriate charts. (2) Include 'internal transactions' in this reporting.
